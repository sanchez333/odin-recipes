# odin-recipes
Odin project foundations recipe website


This project was a good introduction in making a basic website composed of multiple pages with lists and images.

Unfortunately, after doing most of the project and making commits as I was working, 
I checked my github page only to find that none of the commits were being pushed to github, 
even though git said they were.

After some trouble shooting, I figured out at some point I had made the recipes 
folder within the odin-recipes repository into a submodule, which was causing all sorts of problems.

All sorted now, the website works as intended, but unfortunately I lost most 
of my commits in regards to my flow of work for creating and modifying the recipe pages.

Unfortunate, but a mistake I will not make again.
